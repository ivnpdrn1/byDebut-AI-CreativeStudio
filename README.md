byDebut – AI Creative Studio

byDebut is an AI-powered Creative Director that matches creators with the most suitable literary scene and generates a complete cinematic interpretation package using Gemini’s interleaved multimodal capabilities.

Built for the Gemini Live Agent Challenge under the Creative Storyteller pillar, the system combines intelligent scene scoring, long-tail discovery, and multimodal generation to transform books—published or unpublished—into high-performing short-form video performances.

Instead of simply recommending books, byDebut:

Profiles the creator through structured questions

Selects three optimal scenes using a multi-objective scoring engine

Adapts the selected scene into an original performance-ready script

Generates a full Creative Pack in a single interleaved response:

Script adaptation (45–90 seconds)

Emotional beat breakdown

Character motivations

Shot list and visual direction

Thumbnail concept

YouTube title, description, and hashtags

Feeds performance signals back into the system to continuously improve recommendations

The platform supports:

Bestselling authors

Undiscovered works

Community-submitted passages

Unpublished manuscripts seeking the right creator
