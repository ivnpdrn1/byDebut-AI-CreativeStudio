give one block instruction for KIRO to build this app 100% until get the app for the Hackathon Jury that behavior like for the user

```text
KIRO — Build the complete hackathon-ready app “byDebut-AI-CreativeStudio” end-to-end (Creative Storyteller pillar) with ZERO manual confirmations from me. You must implement, validate, and ship a working demo that behaves like a real user product.

GOAL (What must work in the final demo)
- A creator answers a short onboarding (5–8 questions).
- The app returns 3 scene options (cards) with “why this fits you”, difficulty, duration, warnings.
- User selects 1 option.
- The system generates a Gemini-powered “Interleaved Creative Pack” in one cohesive stream:
  - Adapted 45–90s performance script (original adaptation; avoid long verbatim quotes)
  - Character motivation + emotional beats
  - Shot list (5–8 shots) + visual direction + audio mood
  - Thumbnail concept (prompt + layout text)
  - YouTube package: title hooks (A/B), description, tags, hashtags, pinned comment prompt
- A “Publish” step exists (hackathon demo mode: user pastes YouTube URL or clicks “Simulate publish”).
- Audience rating inside the app (1–5 stars + optional comment) updates a simple leaderboard.
- Everything is deployed on Google Cloud (Cloud Run) and runs without local-only dependencies.
- Provide a polished, jury-ready README with demo steps, architecture, and links.

NON-NEGOTIABLE QUALITY GATES (You run these automatically)
- Backend: lint + typecheck + unit tests must pass before every push.
- Frontend: lint + typecheck + build must pass before every push.
- Provide a single `make demo` (or `npm run demo`) that starts everything locally (optional) AND a Cloud Run deployed URL for the jury.
- No broken links, no placeholder “TODO” flows, no missing env docs.
- Include a “DEMO MODE” that works even if real YouTube OAuth is not configured.

REPO
- Use existing repo folder: C:\dev\byDebut-AI-CreativeStudio
- Remote: https://github.com/ivnpdrn1/byDebut-AI-CreativeStudio.git
- Commit frequently with clear messages; push only when gates pass.

TECH STACK (Hackathon-simple, production-credible)
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind (clean UI, card-based flow)
- Backend: Python FastAPI (or Node/TS Express if faster for you) running on Cloud Run
- Gemini: Google GenAI SDK + Gemini ADK orchestration (Creative Storyteller) hosted on Google Cloud
- Storage: Firestore (profiles, scenes, ratings) + Cloud Storage (optional artifacts)
- Retrieval: Start with tag/rule filtering + optional embeddings; if embeddings, use Vertex AI Vector Search (nice-to-have)

ARCHITECTURE YOU MUST IMPLEMENT
1) agent/ (Gemini ADK)
   - byDebutCreativeDirectorAgent orchestrator
   - Tools (function calling) exposed via backend:
     - retrieve_candidate_scenes(profile)
     - score_and_rank_scenes(profile, candidates)
     - generate_adaptation(scene, profile)  // paraphrase/adaptation only
     - generate_interleaved_creative_pack(scene, profile, script)
     - log_outcomes(feedback | publish)
   - Output must be structured JSON for UI rendering AND also renderable as an interleaved stream.

2) api/ (FastAPI)
   Endpoints:
   - POST /api/recommendations  (returns top 3 cards)
   - POST /api/generate-pack    (returns Creative Pack sections)
   - POST /api/feedback         (stores rating/comment + updates leaderboard)
   - POST /api/seed             (dev-only: seed scene dataset)
   - GET  /api/health
   - DEMO MODE toggle via env: DEMO_MODE=true uses deterministic stub data if Gemini not configured

3) web/ (Next.js)
   Pages:
   - /  (onboarding questions)
   - /options (3 cards)
   - /pack (interleaved creative pack viewer + copy buttons)
   - /publish (paste URL or “simulate publish”)
   - /leaderboard (top videos + ratings)
   UI:
   - Minimal, clean, fast. No clutter.
   - Loading states, error states, and “demo mode” badge.

DATA MODEL (Minimum)
- scenes: { id, title, author, source_type, language, tags, duration_s, difficulty, sensitive_topics, short_context, seed_text, copyright_risk }
- ratings: { id, user_id, scene_id, stars, comment, created_at }
- publishes: { id, user_id, scene_id, youtube_url, created_at }
- users/profiles: { user_id, answers, preferences, created_at }

SCORING ENGINE (Must be implemented exactly, deterministic)
- Fit + PerformancePrior + Discovery - Risk + Quality
- Hard filters for blocked topics, language mismatch, resource constraints
- Diversity: do not return 3 near-identical options (use MMR-style penalty or rules)
- Return “why this fits” bullets for each option derived from user answers + tags match.

SEED DATA (Must be safe + hackathon-legal)
- Provide a seed JSON with 30–50 “scene records” using: public domain works + original micro-scenes + community-style submissions
- Do NOT store or output long verbatim copyrighted text.
- For each scene, store only short context and an “adaptation prompt”.
- Include at least:
  - 10 public domain (e.g., classics)
  - 10 “unknown author” synthetic entries (clearly marked as original)
  - 10 community-submitted style entries
  - 5 unpublished demo entries (author_verified=true demo)

GEMINI / ADK IMPLEMENTATION (Creative Storyteller requirements)
- Use Gemini model via Google GenAI SDK.
- The “Creative Pack” must be interleaved: script + structured sections + optional image prompts.
- Output schema (example):
  - pack: { hook, script, beats[], character_notes, shot_list[], audio_mood, thumbnail:{concept,prompt}, youtube:{titles[], description, tags[], hashtags[], pinned_comment} }
- Provide a “Generate again” button that re-calls /generate-pack with same inputs but different seed.

DEPLOYMENT (Required)
- Cloud Run backend (api) with env vars documented.
- Frontend deploy (either Cloud Run or Firebase Hosting). Choose fastest path; must be accessible by judges.
- Provide a single “Jury Demo URL” in README plus a 5-step “How to demo” section.
- Add simple telemetry logs (Cloud Logging) for request_id and stage timings.

AUTOMATED VALIDATION + CI (Required)
- Add GitHub Actions workflow:
  - backend: install deps, lint, test
  - frontend: install deps, lint, typecheck, build
- Block merges on failing checks.

DELIVERABLES (Must exist in repo)
- README.md: product, demo steps, architecture diagram (ASCII ok), env setup, deployed links
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: ADK tools + flows
- docs/DEMO_SCRIPT.md: 90-second jury script
- Makefile or root scripts:
  - `make dev` (runs api + web locally)
  - `make test` (runs all)
  - `make deploy` (deploys to GCP; can be scripted)

EXECUTION PLAN (Do this in order, no questions)
1) Create repo structure (agent/, api/, web/, data/, docs/) + .gitignore
2) Implement backend endpoints + demo-mode + seed loader + scoring engine + tests
3) Implement ADK agent orchestration + Gemini calls + JSON schema output + demo-mode stubs
4) Implement Next.js UI flow end-to-end with polished UX and API integration
5) Add Firestore integration (or in-memory fallback in DEMO_MODE) + leaderboard
6) Add GitHub Actions CI
7) Deploy to Google Cloud and verify end-to-end on deployed URLs
8) Write docs + 90s demo script + finalize README
9) Final smoke test: complete user journey in deployed environment; fix anything broken
10) Push final commits and tag release `hackathon-jury-ready`

OUTPUT TO ME
- Provide: deployed URLs, exact demo steps, and any required env variables.
- Provide: final checklist confirming every quality gate passed (paste command outputs).
- Do not ask me to confirm anything; make reasonable defaults and ship.
